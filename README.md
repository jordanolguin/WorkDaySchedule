# WorkDaySchedule

This is a fully functional work day scheduler for the busy 9-5 worker to plan their day.

## Usage

This application is simple and intuitive. Enter tasks that you would like to keep track of during the desired time block. Click the blue save icon to the right of the task to save the task to the localStorage and to the DOM so that the user can keep track of them even as the page refreshes. The current day of the week and month and date (numeric value) is automatically updated with DayJS. Please refer to attached screenshot.
